# ChessEngine (Easter nights project)

*An attempt to write a chess engine using python with zero knowledge what I do*

let's define a "success" as when this thing beats me (my chess.com rating ~1500) 
 

### Some concepts to learn on the way:

### Chess databases:

### AI representation of chess problem

- [G. Hotz twitchchess](https://gitshub.com/geohot/twitchchess)

Objective Value: V = f(state) 

let's assume:
- V = -1 black wins board state
- V = 0 draw board state
- V = 1 white wins board state 


State(Board):

Pieces (2 + 7*2 = 16):
- Universal
    - Blank
    - Blank (en passant - target square = 64bits)
- Pieces 
    - Pawn
    - Bishop
    - Knight
    - Rook (can castle)
    - Queen
    - King

Extra state:
- To move

Neurons:
8x8x4 + 1 = 257 bits (vector of 0 or 1)
